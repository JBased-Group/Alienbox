	// description shown on the main menu when choosing which campaign to play
	"CampaignDescription" "After an extended period of silence, a distress call has been received from the Lugdunum colony on Cassius-III, likely tying into a series of unprecedented extraterrestrial incursions registered throughout the outer rims. It is presumed, if supported, for Lugdunum to stand among the first casualties of the alien threat. The mission: to probe for information within the facility, then decide whether or not to take further action based on the intel gathered."

Have someone who knows their stuff in electronics, and give it all you have. Good luck, marines."
